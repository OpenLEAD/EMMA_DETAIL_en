  abstract = {In this paper, a simple redundant space robot is proposed to assist astronauts and execute extra-vehicular activities (EVA) on a space station. Different from conventional space station robots, proposed robot has good mobility and high coverage in space station modules. The improvement is mainly contributed by a novel rail and robot base. The rail is designed with a circular shape so it can cover most exterior of the space station modules. Robot arm is designed in high accuracy, 6 meter long and 7 degree of freedom with redundant and modular joints. It is also designed in symmetrical configuration to have walking capability among the space station modules. This paper discusses the robot design and tasks simulation.},

@article{Moon2015,
  abstract = {Recently, the number of high-rise building has increased along with the development of technology to cope with the increase in population. Because of this, many researches on an automatic building fa{\c{c}}ade maintenance system have been conducted to satisfy the increasing demands of fa{\c{c}}ade maintenance. However, most researches have focused on the mechanism and system composition, while working safety issues have not been sufficiently dealt with. This paper deals with the motion control issues of the building fa{\c{c}}ade maintenance robot system which is composed of a vertical robot and a horizontal robot moving along the rail of the fa{\c{c}}ade. With consideration for the vertical robot, these issues include the safety of docking process and the stability of vertical motion. During the docking process for the inter-floor circulation of the horizontal robot, shocks and positioning errors are generated due to increasing load. To solve this, the rail brake system is operated to suppress the shock during the docking process, and a re-leveling process is conducted to compensate the gap which is equal to the positioning error between the built-in transom rail of the robot and the transom rail of the building. In addition, many noises are generated from the surroundings that significantly affect the motion of the vertical robot due to vibration. To enhance the motion stability of the vertical robot, vibration suppression control is developed in this paper, using the state estimation which considers the dynamic properties of the wire rope. For the feasibility of this algorithm, the field experiment of the building fa{\c{c}}ade maintenance robot is conducted.},
