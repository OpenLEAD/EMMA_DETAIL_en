The robot's base is composed by the support, movement and anchorage elements.
The support elements are those that make up the main body of the base and are
responsible for the connecting all elements, providing lift to the whole system.
Movement elements are used to place the arm on the ideal positions for the
process, they  are usually rail and carriage plus some joints on the rail, but
linear actuators, rotational actuators, bearings also fit in this category. For
the anchorage elements, there are two available options: soldering or magnetic
coupling. The magnetic coupling has the advantage of not requiring extra
equipments harming the runner's area. As its effectiveness has been
validated through experimental testing, it's, so, the principal alternative.
